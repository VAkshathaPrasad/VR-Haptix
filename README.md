Haptic feedback for stroke rehabilitation in virtual environment

This project integrates a Haptic Feedback System for stroke rehabilitation within a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. The system combines immersive VR gameplay with a haptic glove to provide real-time feedback, helping users perform rehabilitation exercises in a home-like setting. It was developed as part of the MECPS Program at UC Irvine and awarded 2nd place in the department.

Project Overview

The project involves:

1. A VR game designed using Unity and XR plugins to simulate home-like environments for rehabilitation exercises.
2. A haptic glove that provides vibrational feedback using multiple actuators controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller.
3. Integration of a TCA9548A I2C multiplexer, DRV2605L haptic driver, and ERM haptic motors to enable simultaneous actuator feedback with varying intensities.
4. PCB design and hardware testing to integrate the system and ensure reliable performance.

Project Features

1. Immersive VR Environment: A home-like VR environment to simulate realistic rehabilitation exercises (poke, grab, pinch functionalities).
2. Real-time Haptic Feedback: Multiple actuators vibrate simultaneously with varying intensities based on the userâ€™s interactions.
3. Interactive Therapy: Designed to improve the stroke rehabilitation experience by engaging users with an interactive system.
